# Getting Started

This task was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I've used:

- React Router for navigation
- React context for state managment
- Bootstrap for styles
- Typescript for typing

To start the wiki in your browser, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
